# Perceptual Hashing Framework

Welcome to the PerceptionHash Framework repository. This framework allows you to test and compare various perceptual hashing methods and analyze their performance. Below is a detailed overview of the repository structure and the purpose of each file and folder.

## Repository Structure

### Folders

- **hash_methods**: Contains different perceptual hashing methods.
- **results_methods**: Contains the different types of results that can be generated by the framework.
- **scripts**: Holds multiple small scripts for tasks such as plotting, quick lookups, and other small tasks.

### Files

- **CacheGenerator.py**: Used to cache hashes to avoid recalculating them on each run.
- **DatabaseGenerator.py**: Generates a database of perceptual hashes for comparison.
- **ImagesDistorter.py**: Distorts the images in various ways to test the robustness of the hashing methods.
- **PerceptionHash.py**: The main framework file where you can define which images to compare to what databases, which hashing methods to use, and which results you want to produce.
- **Settings.json**: Defines the settings for input folders and other configurations. **Ensure you check this file to verify its correctness**.
- **Utilities.py**: Contains utility functions that are regularly used across different scripts and modules.
